    "mesh_description": "The Discord MCP provides comprehensive integration with Discord servers, enabling AI agents to manage and automate Discord communities. This MCP includes a full-featured Discord bot that indexes messages, tracks reactions, and logs moderation actions to a PostgreSQL database. AI agents can send, edit, and delete messages; search message history; manage channels and threads; create, edit, and assign roles; moderate members (kick, ban, timeout, mute); and execute webhooks. The bot supports both prefix commands and @mentions, works in servers and DMs, and maintains conversation context for natural AI interactions. Built-in tools include member search by username, role management, channel organization, and database queries for historical data including deleted/edited messages. Ideal for community managers, moderators, and developers who want to automate Discord server management, build custom moderation workflows, or create AI-powered community assistants. Supports real-time message indexing, audit logging, and integration with the Mesh platform for AI model selection."

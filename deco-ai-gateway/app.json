    "mesh_description": "The Deco AI Gateway provides a unified LLM interface powered by OpenRouter, with automatic API key provisioning per organization. When an org installs this MCP, it receives its own isolated OpenRouter API key — created on the first LLM call, stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in Supabase, and reused on subsequent calls. This enables per-org cost tracking and spending visibility directly from OpenRouter's dashboard. Key features: **Auto Provisioning** — no manual key management; the gateway creates and stores the org key transparently on first use. **Multi-model support** — access GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and 300+ models via a single MCP. **Cost Visibility** — use the GATEWAY_USAGE tool to query real-time spending (daily, weekly, monthly) for the org's key. **Isolation** — each org has an independent OpenRouter key named `decocms-mesh-org-{name}-{id}` for easy identification. **Encryption** — keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM before being stored in Supabase. Ideal for teams that want governed, observable, and cost-controlled LLM access without managing API keys manually."

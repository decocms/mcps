The platform handles browser lifecycle management, resource cleanup, and provides reliable execution at scale. Perfect for web scraping projects, automated testing pipelines, monitoring services, PDF generation from HTML, and any workflow requiring programmatic browser control. Supports full Puppeteer and Playwright APIs with additional Cloudflare-specific optimizations.

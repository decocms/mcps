    "mesh_description": "The Grain MCP is maintained by Deco and built on top of Grain public APIs. It lets AI agents list recordings, retrieve full meeting details, fetch only transcripts or summaries to reduce token usage, and search indexed recordings stored in Supabase. The MCP creates and manages Grain webhooks so new recording events are indexed automatically, enabling fast local search while still supporting direct API access for complete data."

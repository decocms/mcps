The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to allow AI agents, IDEs, and automation tools to consume, query, and analyze structured data through context-aware APIs.

This server wraps Blockscout APIs and exposes blockchain data—balances, tokens, NFTs, contract metadata—via MCP so that AI agents and tools (like Claude, Cursor, or IDEs) can access and analyze it contextually.

**Key Features:**

- Contextual blockchain data access for AI tools
- Multi-chain support via getting Blockscout instance URLs from Chainscout
- **Versioned REST API**: Provides a standard, web-friendly interface to all MCP tools. See [API.md](API.md) for full documentation.
- Custom instructions for MCP host to use the server
- Intelligent context optimization to conserve LLM tokens while preserving data accessibility
- Smart response slicing with configurable page sizes to prevent context overflow
- Opaque cursor pagination using Base64URL-encoded strings instead of complex parameters
- Automatic truncation of large data fields with clear indicators and access guidance
- Standardized ToolResponse model with structured JSON responses and follow-up instructions
- Enhanced observability with MCP progress notifications and periodic updates for long-running operations

## Enhanced Analysis with Agent Skills

For more powerful and efficient blockchain analysis, install the **Blockscout Analysis** skill from the [agent-skills repository](https://github.com/blockscout/agent-skills). This skill provides AI agents with structured guidance for execution strategies, response handling, security best practices, and workflow orchestration.

**Learn more**: See the [agent-skills README](https://github.com/blockscout/agent-skills) for full capabilities and installation instructions.

## Development & Deployment

### Local Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockscout/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server
uv pip install -e . # or `pip install -e .`
```

To customize the leading part of the `User-Agent` header used for RPC requests,
set the `BLOCKSCOUT_MCP_USER_AGENT` environment variable (defaults to
"Blockscout MCP"). The server version is appended automatically.

### Running the Server

The server runs in `stdio` mode by default:

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server
```

**HTTP Mode (MCP only):**

To run the server in HTTP Streamable mode (stateless, SSE responses by default):

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http
```

You can also specify the host and port for the HTTP server:

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
```

**Development Mode (Plain JSON Responses):**

For development and testing with simple HTTP clients (curl, Insomnia), you can enable plain JSON responses instead of SSE streams:

```bash
export BLOCKSCOUT_DEV_JSON_RESPONSE=true
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http
```

**Note:** This disables Server-Sent Events (SSE) and progress notifications. Only use this for local testing and debugging.

**Tunneling with Ngrok (Development Mode):**

The Python MCP SDK enforces DNS rebinding protection, which blocks requests from ngrok tunnels by default. To enable
tunneling for development and testing:

1. Start an ngrok tunnel to your local server:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

1. Configure the allowed host and origin using your ngrok URL:

   ```bash
   export BLOCKSCOUT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS="your-tunnel-id.ngrok-free.app"
   export BLOCKSCOUT_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-tunnel-id.ngrok-free.app"
   python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http
   ```

**Note:** These settings are primarily for development use. When these variables are not set, DNS rebinding protection
is automatically determined by the server's bind host: enabled for localhost, disabled for non-localhost (e.g.,
`0.0.0.0`). If your Host header includes a non-standard port, use the `:*` wildcard suffix (e.g.,
`"example.com:*"`) or specify the exact host:port value.

For more details on ngrok tunneling with MCP servers, see the [OpenAI Apps SDK Examples
documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples/blob/main/README.md#testing-in-chatgpt).

**HTTP Mode with REST API:**

To enable the versioned REST API alongside the MCP endpoint, use the `--rest` flag (which requires `--http`).

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --rest
```

With custom host and port:

```bash
python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --rest --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
```

**CLI Options:**

- `--http`: Enables HTTP Streamable mode.
- `--http-host TEXT`: Host to bind the HTTP server to (default: `127.0.0.1`).
- `--http-port INTEGER`: Port for the HTTP server (default: `8000`).
- `--rest`: Enables the REST API (requires `--http`).

### Building Docker Image Locally

Build the Docker image with the official tag:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest .
```

### Pulling from GitHub Container Registry

Pull the pre-built image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest
```

### Running with Docker

**HTTP Mode (MCP only):**

To run the Docker container in HTTP mode with port mapping:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --http-host 0.0.0.0
```

With custom port:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
```

**HTTP Mode with REST API:**

To run with the REST API enabled:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/blockscout/mcp-server:latest python -m blockscout_mcp_server --http --rest --http-host 0.0.0.0
```

**Note:** When running in HTTP mode with Docker, use `--http-host 0.0.0.0` to bind to all interfaces so the server is accessible from outside the container.

**Stdio Mode:** The default stdio mode is designed for use with MCP hosts/clients (like Claude Desktop, Cursor) and doesn't make sense to run directly with Docker without an MCP client managing the communication.

### Testing with Claude Desktop

Use MCP bundle to test the server with Claude Desktop.

1. Build the bundle as per instructions in [mcpb/README.md](mcpb/README.md).
2. Open Claude Desktop.
3. Double-click to open the `blockscout-mcp-dev.mcpb` file to automatically install the bundle.
4. Configure the Blockscout MCP Server URL when prompted (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`)

## Privacy and Anonymous Telemetry

To help us improve the Blockscout MCP Server, community-run instances of the server collect anonymous usage data by default. This helps us understand which tools are most popular and guides our development efforts.

**What we collect:**

- The name of the tool being called (e.g., `get_block_number`).
- The parameters provided to the tool.
- The version of the Blockscout MCP Server being used.

**What we DO NOT collect:**

- We do not collect any personal data, IP addresses (the central server uses the sender's IP for geolocation via Mixpanel and then discards it), secrets, or private keys.

### How to Opt-Out

You can disable this feature at any time by setting the following environment variable:

```bash
export BLOCKSCOUT_DISABLE_COMMUNITY_TELEMETRY=true
```

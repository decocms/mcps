/**
 * Central export point for all tools organized by domain.
 *
 * This file aggregates all tools from different domains into a single
 * export, making it easy to import all tools in main.ts while keeping
 * the domain separation.
 *
 * Example: Add your tools here:
 *   import { myTools } from "./my-tools.ts";
 *   export const tools = [...myTools];
 */

/**
 * Notify carrier with app
 *
 * Notifies the carrier about a dispatch order by calling the `vtex.carrier-notifier app`. When the call is made, the following data is sent:
 *
 * - Dispatched packages information.
 *
 * - Fiscal information about the carrier notified.
 *
 * - Carrier's contact email.
 *
 * The call's response includes all tracking data and each package's ID generated by the notification made to the carrier.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * Any user or [API key](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-api-keys) must have at least one of the appropriate [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to be able to successfully run this request. Otherwise they will receive a status code `403` error. These are the applicable resources for this endpoint:
 *
 * | **Product** | **Category** | **Resource** |
 * | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
 * | Logistics | Logistics access | **Transportation read only** |
 *
 * There are no applicable [predefined roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy) for this resource list. You must [create a custom role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) and add at least one of the resources above in order to use this endpoint. To learn more about machine authentication at VTEX, see [Authentication overview](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/authentication).
 *
 * >❗ To prevent integrations from having excessive permissions, consider the [best practices for managing API keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/best-practices-api-keys--7b6nD1VMHa49aI5brlOvJm) when assigning License Manager roles to integrations.

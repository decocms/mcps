 * Create contract
 *
 * Creates a new contract with an ID automatically generated by VTEX, stored in the `CL` data entity. The request body is a JSON object where the key is the name of the field.
 *
 * > ⚠️ When creating contracts you must send each field according to the specifications provided. Otherwise, the Checkout module will not be able to autofill data during the shopping flow, which can block the purchase. Learn more about [SmartCheckout - Customer information automatic fill-in](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/smartcheckout-preenchimento-automatico-de-dados-do-cliente--2Nuu3xAFzdhIzJIldAdtan#).
 *
 * >⚠️ This endpoint is only available for B2B Buyer Portal. Authorization from the Commerce Engineer of the account is required for usage.
 *
 * Authentication requires the `VtexIdclientAutCookie` header.
 *
 * **Note**: Only the following restriction fields are accepted:
 *
 * - `vtex.catalog.collectionIds`
 * - `vtex.checkout.creditCards`
 * - `vtex.payments.paymentSystemIds`
 *
 * ## Permissions

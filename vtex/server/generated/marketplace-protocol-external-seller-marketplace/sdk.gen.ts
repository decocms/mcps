/**
 * Send agreement for order modifications
 *
 * This endpoint sends an agreement for an order modification to VTEX. It can be used by external sellers to acknowledge that a modification request was made and confirm that the modification has been applied to their order.
 *
 * After a shopper requests a modification, VTEX automatically calls the external seller through the new client, sending a request to the [Create order modifications](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#patch-/api/order-system/orders/-changeOrderId-/changes) endpoint while also sending the order modifications agreement with `agreementType: Acknowledgment`, indicating that it is waiting for a response from the seller.
 *
 * When the seller receives the modification request, they must use this same endpoint with `agreementType` also set to `Acknowledgment`, to register they acknowledge the request and are going to apply the modifications to the order.
 *
 * In the confirmation step, VTEX sends `agreementType: Confirmation`, and waits for a callback from the seller. Once the seller modifies the order, they must respond by calling this same endpoint with `agreementType` set to `Confirmation`. This allows the flow to proceed normally and the modification to be completed successfully.
 *
 * > ⚠️ The system only considers the modification as applied when it receives the status `Confirmation` from the external seller.
 *
 * The steps for the agreement flow are as follows:
 *
 * 1. Shopper requests modifications.
 *
 * 2. VTEX sends `Acknowledgment` to the External Seller.
 *
 * 3. External Seller sends `Acknowledgment` back to VTEX.
 *
 * External Seller uses this endpoint to acknowledge the request for modifications and inform that they will apply them to the order.
 *
 * 4. VTEX sends `Confirmation` to the External Seller.
 *
 * 5. External Seller sends `Confirmation` back to VTEX.
 *
 * External Seller uses this endpoint to confirm the modifications have been applied to the order.
 *
 * 6. The order flow continues.

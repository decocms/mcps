 *
 * The first step for connectors to integrate with [Offer Management](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors) is to create a channel, that represents the marketplace to where sellers will send their offers.
 *
 * This endpoint creates a channel and the integration developers should call it once for each marketplace. The information about the marketplace sent in the request will be shown to sellers in their [Offer Management UI](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/offers-listing--7MRb9S78aBdZjFGpbuffpE).
 *
 * The `feedId` created by this call will apply to all sellers connected to the given channel, and will be necessary for the next step of the integration flow, which is to [activate feed](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis-offer-management#post-/api/sent-offers/feeds).

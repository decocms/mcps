/**
 * Create seller from lead
 *
 * This endpoint is used by marketplace operators to create seller accounts. The request will only accept seller leads whose status is `accepted`. If they are already `connected` or `invited`, the call will not be fulfilled.
 *
 * >❗ The creation of the account at VTEX is done by an internal Billing service. There is no seller account and marketplace affiliation if you do not go through this step.
 *
 * Note that there's no specific API call that allows status changes. The operations only allow the seller lead to move forward:
 *
 * From `invite` > to `Accepted` > closing on `Create Seller`.
 *
 * If you want to change the status, you can start the process again, by deleting that lead through the *[Delete seller lead](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis#delete-/seller-register/pvt/seller-leads/-sellerLeadId-)* endpoint, and resending the invite through the *[Resend seller lead's invite](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis/#put-/seller-register/pvt/seller-leads/-sellerLeadId-/status)* endpoint.

 * Upsert sales channel mapping
 *
 * This endpoint allows the marketplace to map its [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-trade-policies-work--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) with a seller's [affiliate](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-affiliates--tutorials_187). A seller can have multiple [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-trade-policies-work--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) associated with the same marketplace, creating different affiliates. The mapping allows the seller to segment catalog, pricing, inventory, logistics, and payments in the marketplace.

 * ## Permissions
 *
 * Any user or [API key](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-api-keys) must have at least one of the appropriate [License Manager capabilities](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) in order to successfully execute this request. Otherwise, they will receive a `403` status code error. These are the applicable capabilities for this endpoint:
 *
 * | **Product** | **Category** | **Resource** |
 * | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
 * | Seller Register | Seller Administration | **Save seller** |
 *
 * You can [create a custom role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) with this resource or use one of the following [predefined roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy):
 *
 * | **Role** | **Resource** |
 * | --------------- | ----------------- |
 * | Seller Manager | Save Seller |
 *
 * >❗ Assigning a [predefined role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy) to users or application keys typically grants permission to several [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3). If some of these permissions are not required, consider creating a custom role.
